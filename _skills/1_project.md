## Background

As a dog behaviorist specializing in aggressive, fearful, and anxious animals, I worked with families, guardians, and animal rescue organizations to address complex behavioral issues. One challenging aspect of this work involved decisions around behavioral euthanasia for otherwise healthy animals, which often faced significant emotional and mental struggles that caused harm to themselves or their caretakers.

Behavioral euthanasia is a deeply challenging decision that impacts everyone involved, from veterinarians to pet guardians. For veterinarians, the moral stress of making such decisions can have lasting effects, while guardians may be left with feelings of guilt and a reluctance to adopt again. On the other hand, veterinarians are sometimes faced with requests to euthanize animals exhibiting behaviors that, while inconvenient for the client, do not cause significant harm. This scenario also contributes to moral stress, underscoring the need for a clear, structured approach to guide these difficult decisions.

Recognizing the need for a solution to support both caregivers and professionals in making these critical decisions, I developed a tool designed to facilitate conversations about behavioral euthanasia. This tool aims to help navigate the ethical complexities and reduce the emotional burden on everyone involved in this difficult process.

## Goals

This tool was designed to support pet guardians, veterinarians, and behaviorists—collectively referred to as the Care Team—in discussing the ethical and practical aspects of behavioral euthanasia. The primary goals of this tool are to:

1) Reduce moral stress for decision-makers and adjacent staff/family members involved in the decision-making process.
2) Consider the well-being of all animals and humans involved, ensuring that the perspectives of all parties are taken into account.
3) Provide an ethics and responsibilities check, ensuring that ethical principles and professional responsibilities are upheld during difficult deliberations.

## Domains

The tool is structured around eight key domains that address both ethical and pragmatic considerations. These domains help guide the Care Team in understanding the complex issues at play, from the moral justification for euthanasia to the practical realities and responsibilities involved. Through these domains, the tool aims to facilitate an informed, ethical, and thoughtful approach to behavioral euthanasia, supporting all involved in this difficult process.

**Ethical Domains**
1. Animal
2. Guardian
3. Family
4. Society
5. Human-Animal Relationship
   
These domains consider ethical and moral justifications for for or against euthanasia. 

**Pragmatic Domains**
1. Human-Animal Relationship
2. Pragmatics

These domains focus on the non-moral, practical considerations of euthanasia. While these pragmatic factors may not serve as ethical justifications for euthanasia, they are critical in real-world decision-making. If these factors cannot be improved, they may lead to significant moral and ethical concerns.

**Professional/Responsibility Check Domains**
1. Human-Animal Relationship
2. Behavior Modification / Due Diligence
3.  Professional Responsibility

These domains ensure that professional responsibilities are respected and that due diligence is applied to all aspects of the decision-making process, offering a responsibility check to the Care Team.
